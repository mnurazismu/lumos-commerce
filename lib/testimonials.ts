            "As a designer, I'm drawn to products that celebrate their construction. LUMOS keyboards are the only peripherals on my desk that match my design philosophy — beauty in every detail, nothing hidden.",

            "I've spent years building software. LUMOS lets me appreciate hardware the same way. Seeing the PCB traces and switch mechanisms while I code is oddly satisfying. Plus, the typing feel is top-tier.",

            "Transparency as a design language is bold. LUMOS executes it with precision that most brands can't match. The Crystal Speaker is a masterpiece — I keep it on my shelf as much for its looks as its sound.",
